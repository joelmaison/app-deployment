"To calculate the average seating capacity of the mentioned venues:

1. Kigali Arena: 10,000
2. Cairo Stadium Indoor Halls Complex: 16,000
3. Dakar Arena: 15,000
4. Arena Kilamba: 13,000
5. Salle Omnisports de Rades: 17,000
6. Ellis Park Arena: 5,000
7. Sun Arena: (capacity not provided)
8. TicketPro Dome: (capacity not provided)

Since the capacities of Sun Arena and TicketPro Dome are not provided, we will only consider the venues with known capacities:

Total known seating capacities = 10,000 + 16,000 + 15,000 + 13,000 + 17,000 + 5,000 = 76,000

Number of venues with known capacities = 6

Average seating capacity = Total seating capacities / Number of venues = 76,000 / 6 ≈ 12"	africas_flashy_basketball_arenas_summary.txt, bal_global_investment_summary.txt, basketball_africa_league.txt
