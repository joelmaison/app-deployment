INTRODUCTION
Sport can contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), but it faces significant limitations that prevent it from being a universal solution. These challenges highlight the need to view sport as one tool among many for development.

LIMITATIONS
1. Resource Limitations
- Lack of affordable sports equipment and appropriate playing surfaces.
- Scarcity of funding for coaches and sport science knowledge.
- In areas with food or water insecurity, running sports programs may be inappropriate.
- High costs of professional sports events and broadcasting rights limit access for low-income groups.

2. Access Limitations
- Infrastructure often not adapted for people with disabilities.
- Limited transport options and absence of community structures in rural areas.
- Coaches may lack training to integrate marginalized groups.

3. Social and Cultural Limitations
- Conservative societies may view sport as unnecessary.
- Women and girls face barriers and sometimes explicit restrictions.
- LGBT individuals experience discrimination; studies show 80% witnessed homophobia in sport.
- Ethnic minorities, migrants, and refugees often excluded due to cultural norms.

4. Policy Limitations
- Governments may not prioritize sport in development agendas.
- Lack of supportive legislation for inclusion and infrastructure.
- Internationally, sport lacks secure placement in development budgets.
- Closure of UN Office on Sport for Development and Peace in 2017 created uncertainty.

SIGNIFICANCE
These limitations underscore that sport should complement other development strategies rather than serve as a catch-all approach.
