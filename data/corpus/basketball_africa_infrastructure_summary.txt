INTRODUCTION
Basketball’s popularity in Africa has surged over the past decade, highlighted by events like the Basketball Africa League (BAL) Finals in Rwanda. However, access to courts remains a major challenge, limiting participation and development.

KEY POINTS
- Club Rafiki in Kigali serves as a rare example of accessible basketball infrastructure. Established in 2022 by Giants of Africa, it offers free access and has become a hub for local players.
- Giants of Africa, co-founded by Toronto Raptors president Masai Ujiri, aims to build 100 courts across Africa to address infrastructure gaps.
- Rwanda’s Ministry of Sports acknowledges the need for 2,000 additional courts nationwide to meet demand.
- A 2022 study revealed 39% of Rwandan respondents were dissatisfied with basketball facilities in schools.
- Indoor courts are scarce across Africa, with rural areas facing the greatest challenges.

COMMUNITY IMPACT
Club Rafiki provides a safe space for youth, fostering dreams of professional careers and community engagement. It contrasts with past decades when courts were overcrowded and lacked proper equipment.

FUTURE OUTLOOK
Government initiatives and nonprofit efforts aim to expand infrastructure, but progress will take time. Basketball’s growth in Africa continues to outpace the development of facilities.
