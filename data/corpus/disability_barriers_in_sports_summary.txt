Disability barriers in sports hinder equal participation for athletes, fans, and supporters with disabilities. These obstacles extend beyond training and competitions, affecting access and enjoyment across the sporting ecosystem.

TYPES OF BARRIERS

2. Logistical Accessibility Barriers
- Website accessibility: Non-compliant sites prevent ticket purchases and membership renewals.

- Transportation hurdles: Inaccessible transit and venue navigation difficulties.

3. Psychological Accessibility Barriers

- Under-representation: Limited visibility in mainstream sports media and career pathways.
- Social isolation: Exclusion from sports-related gatherings and communities.
