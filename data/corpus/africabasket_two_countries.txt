INTRODUCTION
The article discusses a significant development in African basketball representation, where two countries will now share the spotlight in global competitions instead of a single representative.

HISTORICAL CONTEXT
Traditionally, African basketball representation in major international events was limited to one dominant country. This approach often sidelined other strong basketball nations despite their talent and achievements.

KEY POINTS
- Decision to allow two African countries to participate in global basketball events.
- Aimed at promoting inclusivity and showcasing broader African talent.
- Reflects the continent’s growing competitiveness in basketball.

SOCIAL IMPACT
This change is expected to inspire young athletes across Africa, increase investment in basketball infrastructure, and strengthen continental unity through sports.

NOTABLE EXAMPLES
- Previous dominance by a single country in AfroBasket and Olympic qualifiers.
- Emerging nations like Nigeria, Senegal, and Angola pushing for greater representation.

LOOKING AHEAD
The new policy could lead to expanded qualification slots, more balanced competition, and enhanced visibility for African basketball on the global stage.
