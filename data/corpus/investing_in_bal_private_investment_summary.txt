INTRODUCTION
The Basketball Africa League (BAL), launched in 2019 by the NBA and FIBA, represents a major opportunity for private investment in African sports. With Africa’s billion-strong population and growing youth demographic, the BAL aims to unlock new markets and talent pipelines.

NOTABLE INVESTORS
- Barack Obama joined as a strategic partner and investor.
- Nigerian investors Babatunde “Tunde” Folawiyo (Yinka Folawiyo Group) and Tope Lawani (Helios Fairfax Partners Corporation) backed the inaugural season.

KEY INVESTMENT AREAS
1. Infrastructure
- African sports infrastructure remains underdeveloped outside soccer.
- BAL teams played in venues averaging 4,600 seats; private investment can improve facilities and create sustainable business models.
- Examples: AGORA project in Côte d’Ivoire and Dakar sports complex with 25% equity funding.

2. Media & Content
- Media rights are central to sports profitability; NBA’s next deal projected at $75bn.
- BAL aired on ESPN, Canal+, BeIN Sports, NBA TV, and Tencent Video.
- Digital streaming and mobile-first strategies are critical for Africa’s 690m smartphone users by 2025.
- Opportunities for US tech giants and African startups in short-form content and OTT platforms.

3. Human Capital
- BAL longevity depends on player development and grassroots programs.
- SEED Project in Dakar has produced NBA/WNBA talent and achieved 92% success in jobs or university placements.
- NGOs and development agencies (AFD, BOAD) are investing in sports education and inclusion.

FUTURE OUTLOOK
- US investors can leverage diaspora ties, tech expertise, and NBA partnerships to capture Africa’s sports market.
- Investments in BAL offer win-win outcomes: education, job creation, and global exposure for African talent.
